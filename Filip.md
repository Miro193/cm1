I did the Book Collection Mangaer. All around I think there is no big problems with this code almost not any at all.
There is a couple of things I would change for example I maybe should have centered the items to be at the center of the page.
I also think it would be more satisfying to have the drop down selector like miro has on his component.
Other than that I have nothing more to complain about overall 8.5/10
